# Tableau_mini_project
A small project creating a Tableau dashboard based on given data.


Requirements: 
Which shippers are causing us problems with shipping delays?

You are an analyst at a company that supplies products from warehouses to customers (other companies) in the U.S. Your company uses several shipment companies (shippers) to ship the products.

Purpose and audience: 
Management has asked you to create a visualisation identifying the shippers that cause the most problems with shipping delays. Managers are comfortable interacting with visualisations, and they will be using desktop computers.

The existing views: 
Your coworkers have created several views intended to help you. One of your coworkers combined some of the team's views in a dashboard. However, your coworkers don't know much about visual best practices. You can use or modify these views if they are helpful, or you may create new views. You may only need a small number of views for the final visualisation. You can revise the dashboard your coworker started, or you can discard it and create a new dashboard or story.

Factors to consider:
You can decide which data best shows the shippers that are causing problems. Factors you might consider include average delays per shipper, total hours of delay per shipper, impact on important customers or profits, and trends over time, but you don't need to show all of those factors. 

Bonus challenge: 
Managers would also like to know which shippers are performing especially well, so they can shift toward using the better shippers more often.
